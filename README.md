TinyPairing
===========

TinyPairing is a pairing-based cryptographic library for wireless sensors. It provides most efficient and lightweight implementation of bilinear pairing, pairing-related functions and associated elliptic curve arithmetic operations such as scalar multiplication, point addition and more.

With the efficient algorithms and memory-saving implementation, the library is able to run public key cryptosystems on sensor platforms, for example MICAz with only 4KB RAM, 128KB ROM, and 7.3828-MHz ATmega128L micro-controller.
